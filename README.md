## Task
The task of this project is to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Description
In this project, we explored a dataset of credit card transactions and built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. We started by analyzing the dataset and visualizing the distribution of features, such as transaction amount and time. We also looked at the class distribution and identified that the dataset was heavily imbalanced, with a very small number of fraudulent transactions.

To address this issue of imbalance, we experimented with different sampling techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE, and found that SMOTE performed the best in improving the model's performance.

We then trained a logistic regression model using the SMOTE method and evaluated its performance using the AUPRC metric. The model achieved an impressive AUPRC score of 0.989, indicating a high level of precision and recall in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
Imblearn

You can install them using pip


## Usage
After installing the required libraries, you can run the project by running the Jupyter notebook named "credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb". This notebook contains all the code used in this project along with explanations and visualizations. You can run the cells one by one to see the output and results of each step.
